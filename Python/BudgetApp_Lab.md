### Budget App

Goal: “Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. These objects should allow for depositing and withdrawing funds from each category, as well computing category balances and transferring balance amounts between categories”


```python
class Budget:

  def depost(self):
    pass
  def withdraw(self):


food = Budget()
clothing = Budget()
```
