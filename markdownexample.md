Ninja git coders are an *elite* group of developers who have mastered the art of coding with the open-source version control system **Git**. This type of coding requires a deep understanding of how the system works and how to use it to its fullest potential. They are able to create complex, distributed software projects in a fraction of the time it would take other developers. Git is a powerful tool that allows for multiple developers to work on the same project and share their changes without having to worry about conflicting code. 

Ninja git coders are able to quickly detect and resolve conflicts, while also being able to quickly add new features and updates to existing projects. They also have the skill to quickly and accurately review code, which is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the code base. 

Finally, they are able to track changes made to the code and easily roll back to a previous version if there is an issue with the current version. With the help of these talented developers, companies can achieve their development goals faster and more efficiently.
